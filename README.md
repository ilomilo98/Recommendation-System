# Recommendation-System
Recommender systems, in a general term, are algorithms that seek to propose relevant items to consumers (items being movies to watch, text to read, products to buy or anything else depending on industries).Â 
In certain sectors, recommender systems are essential since they may produce a considerable amount of revenue or serve as a means to differentiate yourself from rivals.
